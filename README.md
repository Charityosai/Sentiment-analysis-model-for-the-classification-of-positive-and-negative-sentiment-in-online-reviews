Title: Development of a sentiment analysis model for the classification of positive and negative sentiments in online reviews

This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model that will classify online reviews as either positive or negative using text mining and sentiment analysis techniques. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this model aims to enhance our capacity to extract meaningful insights from online reviews and ultimately contribute to a more nuanced understanding of user sentiments and preferences.

The data set was obtained from UCI repository and contains text sentences, extracted from reviews of products, movies, and restaurants from three different websites imdb.com, amazon.com and yelp.com.
